# Bryley's dotfiles

This is a collection of my dotfiles that I use on my Unix setup.
Below is a list of all the programs this is setup for and a short description:

## Setup

To setup simply make this repo your .config file and pull with new changes.
When you start vim for the first time make sure you type `:PlugInstall` to install all the plugins.


## Neovim

The most useful of the bunch, this includes my vimrc with a built-in version of the vim-plug plugin manager.
It has a few plugins installed that can be swapped out faily easily.


## Tmux

This is a really basic version of tmux with the dracula themed taskbar.
Note that this has some submodules in it that is being used.


## Fish

Fish is my shell of choice due to it being comfortable out of the box.
It has a couple of my fish configurations and my theme of choice.

## Alacritty

My terminal emulator of choice is alacritty, my config file is really basic with a few features.
